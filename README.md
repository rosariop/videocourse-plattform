## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project

## Tooling

This project is using OpenWebcomponents / LitHtml as a frontend-framework.
Styling is done by plain CSS due to the reduced complexity of components styling.
The backend technology has to be determined later on.

### Additional Tools used:

- Supabase for authenticating user
- Vaadin router for routing
